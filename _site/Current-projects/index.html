    <h3 style="float: center;"> Ferric iron impacts dissolved organic matter UV absorption measurements 
in natural waters </h3>
<p><img src="/images/BUNN-storm.jpg" width="350" style="float: left; border: 25px solid white;" />
<br /></p>
<p align="justify">
Dissolved organic matter (DOM) UV-vis measurements have been widely used as a cost-efficient and less time-consuming method of estimating DOM composition. However, the presence of ferric iron in filtered water samples results in overestimations of DOM UV-vis absorption. Despite the development of correction factors for ferric iron, they are rarely applied. I address the implications of failing to correct for dissolved ferric iron by examining the impacts on two commonly measured DOM UV-vis parameters (DOM absorption at 254 nm and the specific UV absorption at 254 nm) at 5 sites along the Connecticut River over a 1.5 year period starting in July 2018 and for 7 smaller tributaries in the Connecticut River watershed in the summer 2019.

Iron is a limiting nutrient in coastal zones and oceans. Rivers were not thought to be sources of iron to oceans, since more than 90% of dissolved iron is lost in estuaries due to the increase in salinity. Recently, however, studies have shown that rivers can be significant contributors of iron to coastal zones and open oceans if the iron is complexed with DOM. I address the role of DOM in iron speciation, concentration, and export by the Connecticut River to the Long Island Sound. Seasonality along the downstream aquatic-marine gradient is particularly important; to address this I have been sampling 5 sites along the Connecticut River bi-weekly for 1.5 years. I measure total Fe, Fe(II), Fe(III), DOC, and a range of DOC optical parameters on 2 fraction sizes.

<h3 style="float: left;"> Illuminating riverine dissolved organic carbon dynamics using carbon age </h3>

Understanding the global carbon cycle is essential to predicting future climate change. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the largest carbon reservoirs globally; the amount of carbon stored in oceans alone as DOC exceeds the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. Despite being one of the largest carbon reservoirs globally, riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) sources are poorly quantified. The isotopic signature of 14C can provide important information on riverine DOC age. An aged component of DOC in rivers suggests the mobilization of sequestered carbon stocks in rivers; DOC that was once “removed” from the global carbon cycle (i.e., stored in carbon sinks) that is laterally exported to rivers could potentially be respired or photochemically oxidized and evaded to the atmosphere, thus contributing to global carbon dioxide emissions. I measure the isotopic signature of 14C-DOC and the DOC flux on the Connecticut River seasonally and long-term to address when aged DOC is mobilized in rivers
