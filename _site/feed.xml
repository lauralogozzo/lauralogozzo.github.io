Aquatic primary productivity produces oxygen (O2) and consumes carbon dioxide (CO2) in a 
ratio of ~1.2. However, in aquatic ecosystems, dissolved CO2 concentrations can be low, 
potentially limiting primary productivity. Here, results show that a large drainage basin 
maintains its highest levels of gross primary productivity (GPP) when dissolved CO2 is 
diminished or undetectable due to photosynthetic uptake. Data show that, after CO2 is 
depleted, bicarbonate, an ionized form of inorganic carbon, supports these high levels of 
productivity. In fact, outputs from a process-based model suggest that bicarbonate can 
support up to ~58% of GPP under the most productive conditions. This is the first evidence
 that high levels of aquatic GPP are sustained in a riverine drainage network despite CO2 
 depletion, which has implications for freshwater ecology, biogeochemistry, and isotopic 
 analysis.

Wetlands export chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to estuaries, 
where CDOM is removed and transformed through biotic and abiotic process, subsequently 
impacting nutrient cycling, light availability, ecosystem metabolism, and phytoplankton 
activity. We examined the bioavailability and photoreactivity of CDOM exported from four 
Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes across three seasons and along an estuarine salinity gradient 
using three incubation treatments: 14‐day microbial (MD), 7‐day combined 
photochemical/microbial (PB+MD), and 7‐day microbial incubation after photobleaching 
(MD after PB). CDOM absorption at 300 nm (aCDOM300) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 
concentrations showed strong seasonality, with minima in winter, but CDOM quality 
(absorption spectral slopes, fluorescence component ratios) was less variable seasonally. 
PB+MD over 7 days decreased aCDOM300 (–56.0%), humic‐like fluorescence (–67.6%), 
and DOC (–17.8%), but increased the spectral slope ratio SR (=S275‐295/S300‐350) (+94.8%), 
suggesting a decrease in CDOM molecular weight. Photochemistry dominated the PB+MD 
treatment. Photoreactivity was greater during the winter and in marsh/watershed versus 
down‐estuary sites, likely due to less previous light exposure. Prior photobleaching 
increased the bioavailability of marsh‐exported CDOM, resulting in a greater loss of 
aCDOM300 and DOC, and a greater increase in humic‐like fluorescence (–6.0%, –5.9%, and 
+18.4% change, respectively, over 7‐day MD after PB incubations, versus –2.8%, –5.5%, and 
+2.6% change, respectively, over 14‐day MD incubations). CDOM exported from a marsh 
downstream of a major wastewater treatment plant showed the greatest photoreactivity 
and bioavailability. This highlights the significance of human activity on estuarine 
CDOM quality and biogeochemical cycles.

Narasin is an antibiotic administered to broiler chickens to prevent coccidiosis. 
After storage, excreta containing parent narasin compounds is commonly spread as nitrogen fertilizer, 
yielding initial soil concentrations in the low μg·kg−1 range. In soil, antibiotics have 
been found to modify one or more pathways in the biogeochemical nitrogen cycle. The concentrations 
tested are often too high to be considered environmentally relevant, despite evidence that 
sub-therapeutic doses may also be disruptive. We conducted soil mesocosm experiments to 
determine the overall impact of trace narasin on major nitrogen pools and fluxes in soils 
treated with 0, 1, 10, 100, or 1000 ng·kg−1 narasin. Water content in the mesocosms varied 
from 40% to 80% water-filled pore space (WFPS), simulating a range of different redox 
conditions. Under aerobic conditions (40% WFPS), exposure to narasin inhibited nitrification, 
yielding increases in soil ammonium by up to 76%, perhaps by targeting nitrifying fungi. 
Under the same conditions, narasin caused soil nitrate concentrations to decline 17–39%. 
When the soil was near saturation (80% WFPS), nitrate increased by an average of 30%. 
Mass balances and isotopic enrichment of N2O indicate that NAR may also affect anammox and 
the rate of nitrifier nitrification/denitrification. In aerobic soils, N2O flux increased 
with antibiotic dose and the rise in flux strongly correlates to the N2O:N2 product ratio 
from dentification. This relationship suggests that N2O flux may increase in soils exposed 
to narasin even when total denitrification is modestly inhibited. We conclude that trace 
concentrations of narasin can significantly modify biogeochemical activities in soil on 
short timescales. Our results indicate the potential for extremely low concentrations of 
antibiotics to impact agricultural productivity, terrestrial N2O flux, and non-point source 
nitrogen pollution.
