<p align = "center">
I am a PhD Candidate in Dr. Peter Raymond's lab at the Yale School of the Environment (YSE), formerly known as 
  the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. 
  My research focuses on the biogeochemistry of large river
  systems. In particular, I am interested in interactions between dissolved organic
  matter and iron.

<p align = "center">
  Originally from Brooklyn, NY, I attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, majoring in fine arts.
  I received my B.S. and M.S. from CUNY City College of New York, where I studied Earth 
  and Atmospheric Sciences. My Master's thesis examined the export of colored dissolved 
  organic matter from Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes, and its subsequent photochemical and microbial degradation in estuaries.
