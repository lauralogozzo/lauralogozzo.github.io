Riverine dissolved iron (Fe) affects water color, nutrients, and marine carbon cycling. 
Fe size and coupling with dissolved organic matter (DOM), in part, modulates the 
biogeochemical roles of riverine Fe. We used size fractionation to operationally define 
dissolved Fe (&lt; 0.22 μm) into soluble (&lt; 0.02 μm) and colloidal (0.02–0.22 μm) fractions 
in order to characterize the downstream drivers, concentrations, and fluxes of Fe across 
season and hydrologic regime at the freshwater Connecticut River mainstem, which we 
sampled bi-weekly for 2 yrs. Drivers of colloidal and soluble Fe concentrations were 
markedly different. The response of colloidal Fe concentration to changes in discharge was 
modulated by water temperature; colloidal Fe decreased with increasing discharge at 
temperatures &lt; 10.5°C, but increased with increasing discharge at temperatures &gt; 10.5°C. 
Conversely, soluble Fe concentrations were only positively correlated to discharge at high 
temperatures (&gt; 20°C). Soluble Fe was strongly positively correlated to a humic-like DOM 
fluorescence component, suggesting coupling with DOM subsets, potentially through 
complexation. While average colloidal Fe fluxes varied twofold seasonally, soluble Fe 
fluxes varied ninefold; therefore, soluble Fe variability was more important to the 
overall dissolved Fe variability than colloidal Fe, despite lower concentrations. Seasonal 
Fe fluxes were decoupled from discharge: dissolved and soluble Fe fluxes were greatest in 
the fall, whereas discharge was greatest in the spring. Fluxes of soluble Fe, which may be 
more bioavailable and more likely to be exported to the ocean, were lowest in the summer 
when downstream biological demand is high, having implications for primary productivity 
and iron uptake.
