Wetlands capture and store carbon, and so wetland restoration and preservation 
are potentially effective nature-based climate solutions. Wetlands also provide additional 
ecosystem services such as the treatment of municipal and industrial wastewater through 
intense processing that removes nutrients and other pollutants. 
The Frank Lake wetland complex in southern Alberta, Canada, represents a complicated 
management scenario. Frank Lake is ecologically, economically, and culturally important, 
as it was restored with inputs of agricultural and municipal wastewater beginning in 
1989. While the wetland processes and removes wastewater-derived nutrients, 
the impacts on net carbon storage here and in similar treatment wetlands is unclear. 
To build a whole-ecosystem carbon budget for Frank Lake, we integrate techniques across the 
terrestrial-aquatic boundary for the entire wetland using a combination of 
eddy-covariance measurements, plant biomass sampling and remote sensing of  
shoreline vegetation, water-air greenhouse gas emissions, and targeted sampling of 
lateral carbon inputs and outputs.

The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) is the largest wetland complex in North America, with 
millions of wetlands punctuating the landscapes of Canada and the United States. In this region, 
wetlands have been dramatically impacted by agricultural land use, with unclear implications 
for regional to global greenhouse gas emissions budgets. To address this, we surveyed wetlands across 
all three Canadian prairie provinces in the PPR to determine whether greenhouse gas emissions patterns of carbon 
dioxide (CO<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font>), methane (CH<font size="2"><sub>4</sub></font>), 
and nitrous oxide (N<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font>O) from aquatic habitats differed among 
wetlands embedded in cropland versus grassland habitats. This is an important step toward 
understanding wetland emissions responses to land use in the PPR and other wetland-rich 
agricultural landscapes.

Understanding the global carbon cycle is essential to predicting future climate change. 
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the largest carbon reservoirs globally; 
the amount of carbon stored in oceans alone as DOC exceeds the amount of CO<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> in the atmosphere. 
Despite being one of the largest carbon reservoirs globally, riverine DOC 
sources are poorly quantified. Radiocarbon (<font size="2"><sup>14</sup></font>C) can provide 
important information on riverine DOC age. An increase in DOC age in rivers over time suggests 
the mobilization of once-sequestered terrestrial carbon stocks in rivers, potentially from 
direct or indirect anthropogenic activity. DOC that was once “removed” 
from the global carbon cycle (e.g., stored in terrestrial soils) that is laterally exported 
to rivers could potentially be respired or photochemically oxidized and evaded to the 
atmosphere, thus contributing to global carbon dioxide emissions. I measure 
<font size="2"><sup>14</sup></font>C-DOC on the Connecticut River seasonally and long-term 
to address if and when aged DOC is mobilized in rivers. This is necessary to predict 
anthropogenic perturbations to terrestrial carbon storage. This was was funded by the
NASA Connecticut Space Grant.

In rivers, iron speciation and concentration contribute to water color, affect the cycling 
of nutrients such as phosphorous, and support downstream (i.e., coastal and ocean) aquatic 
productivity and CO<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> uptake. This is because iron is often a limiting nutrient in the coastal 
and open ocean due to the loss of iron in estuaries. Significant riverine export of iron to 
coastal zones is largely dependent on interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM), often 
sourced from terrestrial environments; thus, the cycling of DOM and iron vary temporally, 
as terrestrial sources of iron and DOM depend on changing hydrologic and seasonal drivers. 
I evaluated the concentrations and downstream fluxes of two size fractions of dissolved iron 
in relation to water temperature, river discharge, and DOM composition using long-term frequent 
monitoring on the Connecticut River mainstem. This approach allowed us to establish how the 
timing of the downstream export of iron might impact coastal and ocean productivity and 
CO<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> uptake and determine the mechanistic drivers behind changing iron concentrations.

Dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and amount impacts the functioning of aquatic 
ecosystems by limiting the amount of UV and visible light (UV-vis), controlling nutrient 
cycling and trace metal speciation and fate, and by supporting heterotrophy. Because DOM 
absorbs light, UV-vis absorbance measurements have been widely used as a cost- and time-
efficient method of estimating DOM composition and amount. However, the presence of 
ferric iron in filtered water results in overestimations of DOM UV-vis absorbance. 
We quantified the contributions of dissolved ferric iron to UV-vis absorbance on commonly 
measured DOM UV-vis parameters for natural water samples collected from the Connecticut River 
watershed over 1.5 years. Further, we evaluated how ferric iron interference in UV-vis 
absorbance measurements contributes to systematic biases in the interpretation of DOM 
composition and amount by land-use, season, and hydrology.
