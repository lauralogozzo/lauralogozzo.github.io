Wetlands export chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) to estuaries, 
where CDOM is removed and transformed through biotic and abiotic process, subsequently 
impacting nutrient cycling, light availability, ecosystem metabolism, and phytoplankton 
activity. We examined the bioavailability and photoreactivity of CDOM exported from four 
Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes across three seasons and along an estuarine salinity gradient 
using three incubation treatments: 14‚Äêday microbial (MD), 7‚Äêday combined 
photochemical/microbial (PB+MD), and 7‚Äêday microbial incubation after photobleaching 
(MD after PB). CDOM absorption at 300 nm (aCDOM300) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 
concentrations showed strong seasonality, with minima in winter, but CDOM quality 
(absorption spectral slopes, fluorescence component ratios) was less variable seasonally. 
PB+MD over 7 days decreased aCDOM300 (‚Äì56.0%), humic‚Äêlike fluorescence (‚Äì67.6%), 
and DOC (‚Äì17.8%), but increased the spectral slope ratio SR (=S275‚Äê295/S300‚Äê350) (+94.8%), 
suggesting a decrease in CDOM molecular weight. Photochemistry dominated the PB+MD treatment. Photoreactivity was greater during the winter and in marsh/watershed versus down‚Äêestuary sites, likely due to less previous light exposure. Prior photobleaching increased the bioavailability of marsh‚Äêexported CDOM, resulting in a greater loss of aCDOM300 and DOC, and a greater increase in humic‚Äêlike fluorescence (‚Äì6.0%, ‚Äì5.9%, and +18.4% change, respectively, over 7‚Äêday MD after PB incubations, versus ‚Äì2.8%, ‚Äì5.5%, and +2.6% change, respectively, over 14‚Äêday MD incubations). CDOM exported from a marsh downstream of a major wastewater treatment plant showed the greatest photoreactivity and bioavailability. This highlights the significance of human activity on estuarine CDOM quality and biogeochemical cycles.
