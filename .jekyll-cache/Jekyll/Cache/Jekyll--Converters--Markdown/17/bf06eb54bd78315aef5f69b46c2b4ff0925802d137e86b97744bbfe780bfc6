River networks transport dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial uplands to the 
coastal ocean. The extent to which a reach or lake within a river network uptakes DOC 
depends on the stream order, the seasonal conditions, and the flow. At the watershed 
scale, it remains unclear whether DOC uptake is dominated by biological processes such as 
respiration, or abiotic processes like photomineralization. The partitioning of DOC uptake 
in lakes vs. rivers is also unclear. In this study, we present a new model that unifies 
year-round controls on DOC cycling for an entire river network, including river–lake 
connectivity, to elucidate the importance of biotic vs. abiotic controls on DOC uptake. 
We present the Catchment UPtake and Sinks by Season, Order, and Flow for DOC (CUPS-OF-DOC) 
model, which quantifies terrestrial DOC loading, gross primary productivity, and uptake 
via microbes and photomineralization. The model is applied to the Connecticut River 
Watershed, and accounts for cascading reach- and lake-scale DOC cycling across 98 scenarios 
spanning combinations of flows, seasons, and stream orders. We show that riverine DOC uptake 
is nearly constant with stream order, but the proportion of DOC uptake from photomineralization 
varies. Photomineralization dominates in rivers in most flow conditions and stream orders, 
especially in winter, accounting for at least half of whole-watershed DOC uptake in February 
across all flows. Whole-watershed summer DOC uptake occurs mostly via biomineralization 
in lakes, accounting for 80% of DOC uptake during the growing season, despite accounting 
for less than 6% of watershed open water surface area.
