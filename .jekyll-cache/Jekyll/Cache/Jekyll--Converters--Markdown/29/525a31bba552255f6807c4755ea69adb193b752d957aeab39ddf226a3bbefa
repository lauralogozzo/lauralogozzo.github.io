Aquatic primary productivity produces oxygen (O2) and consumes carbon dioxide (CO2) in a 
ratio of ~1.2. However, in aquatic ecosystems, dissolved CO2 concentrations can be low, 
potentially limiting primary productivity. Here, results show that a large drainage basin 
maintains its highest levels of gross primary productivity (GPP) when dissolved CO2 is 
diminished or undetectable due to photosynthetic uptake. Data show that, after CO2 is 
depleted, bicarbonate, an ionized form of inorganic carbon, supports these high levels of 
productivity. In fact, outputs from a process-based model suggest that bicarbonate can 
support up to ~58% of GPP under the most productive conditions. This is the first evidence
 that high levels of aquatic GPP are sustained in a riverine drainage network despite CO2 
 depletion, which has implications for freshwater ecology, biogeochemistry, and isotopic 
 analysis.
