Dissolved organic matter (DOM) impacts the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. 
DOM absorbs light in the UV and visible (UVâ€“Vis) wavelengths, thus impacting light 
attenuation. Because absorption by DOM depends on its composition, UVâ€“Vis absorbance is 
used to constrain DOM composition, source, and amount. Ferric iron, Fe(III), also absorbs 
in the UVâ€“Vis; when Fe(III) is present, DOM-attributed absorbance is overestimated. Here, 
we explore how differing behavior of DOM and Fe(III) at the catchment scale impacts UVâ€“Vis 
absorbance and evaluate how system-specific variability impacts the effectiveness of 
existing Fe(III) correction factors in a temperate watershed. We sampled five sites 
in the Connecticut River mainstem bi-weekly forâ€‰~â€‰1.5 years, and seven sites in the 
Connecticut River watershed once during the summer 2019. We utilized size fractionation 
to isolate the impact of DOM and Fe(III) on absorbance and show that variable contributions 
of Fe(III) to absorbance at 254 nm (a<font size="2"><sub>254</sub></font>) and 412 nm 
(a<font size="2"><sub>412</sub></font>) by size fraction complicates 
correction for Fe(III). We demonstrate that the overestimation of DOM-attributed absorbance
by Fe(III) is correlated to the Fe(III):dissolved organic carbon concentration ratio; 
thus, overestimation can be high even when Fe(III) is low. a<font size="2"><sub>254</sub></font> overestimation is highly
variable even within a single system, but can be as high as 53%. Finally, we illustrate 
that UV-Vis overestimation might impart bias to seasonal, discharge, and land-use trends
in DOM quality. Together, these findings argue that Fe(III) should be measured in tandem
with UVâ€“Vis absorbance for estimates of CDOM composition or amount.
