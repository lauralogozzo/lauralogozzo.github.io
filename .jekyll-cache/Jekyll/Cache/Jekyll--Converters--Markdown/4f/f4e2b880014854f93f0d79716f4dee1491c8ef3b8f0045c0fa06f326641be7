  I am a PhD Candidate in Dr. Peter Raymond's lab at the Yale School of Forestry 
  and Environmental Studies. My research focuses on the biogeochemistry of large river
  systems. In particular, I am interested in interactions between dissolved organic
  matter and iron.
  <br /><br />
  Originally from Brooklyn, NY, I attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School, majoring in fine arts.
  I received my B.S. and M.S. from CUNY City College of New York, where I studied Earth 
  and Atmospheric Sciences. My Master's thesis examined the export of colored dissolved 
  organic matter from Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes, and its subsequent photochemical and microbial 
  degradation in estuaries.
