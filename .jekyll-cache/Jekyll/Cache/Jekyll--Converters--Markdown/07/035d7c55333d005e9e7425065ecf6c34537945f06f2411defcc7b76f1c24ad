Dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and amount impacts the functioning of aquatic 
ecosystems by limiting the amount of UV and visible light (UV-vis), controlling nutrient 
cycling and trace metal speciation and fate, and by supporting heterotrophy. Because DOM 
absorbs light, UV-vis absorbance measurements have been widely used as a cost- and time-
efficient method of estimating DOM composition and amount. However, the presence of 
ferric iron in filtered water results in overestimations of DOM UV-vis absorbance. 
I quantify the contributions of dissolved ferric iron to UV-vis absorbance on commonly 
measured DOM UV-vis parameters for natural water samples collected from the Connecticut River 
watershed over 1.5 years. Further, I evaluate how ferric iron interference in UV-vis 
absorbance measurements contributes to systematic biases in the interpretation of DOM 
composition and amount by land-use, season, and hydrology.

In rivers, iron speciation and concentration contribute to water color, affect the cycling 
of nutrients such as phosphorous, and support downstream (i.e., coastal and ocean) aquatic 
productivity and CO<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> uptake. This is because iron is often a limiting nutrient in the coastal 
and open ocean due to the loss of iron in estuaries. Significant riverine export of iron to 
coastal zones is largely dependent on interactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM), often 
sourced from terrestrial environments; thus, the cycling of DOM and iron vary temporally, 
as terrestrial sources of iron and DOM depend on changing hydrologic and seasonal drivers. 
I evaluate the concentrations and downstream fluxes of two size fractions of dissolved iron 
in relation to water temperature, river discharge, and DOM composition using long-term frequent 
monitoring on the Connecticut River mainstem. This approach allows us to establish how the 
timing of the downstream export of iron might impact coastal and ocean productivity and 
CO<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> uptake and determine the mechanistic drivers behind changing iron concentrations.

Understanding the global carbon cycle is essential to predicting future climate change. 
Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the largest carbon reservoirs globally; 
the amount of carbon stored in oceans alone as DOC exceeds the amount of CO<font size="2"><sub>2</sub></font> in the atmosphere. 
Despite being one of the largest carbon reservoirs globally, riverine dissolved organic 
carbon (DOC) sources are poorly quantified. Radiocarbon (<font size="2"><sup>14</sup></font>C) can provide 
important information on riverine DOC age. An increase in DOC age in rivers over time suggests 
the mobilization of once-sequestered terrestrial carbon stocks in rivers, potentially from 
direct or indirect anthropogenic activity. DOC that was once “removed” 
from the global carbon cycle (e.g., stored in terrestrial soils) that is laterally exported 
to rivers could potentially be respired or photochemically oxidized and evaded to the 
atmosphere, thus contributing to global carbon dioxide emissions. I measure <font size="2"><sup>15&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;C-DOC
on the Connecticut River seasonally and long-term to address if and when aged 
DOC is mobilized in rivers. This is necessary to predict anthropogenic perturbations to 
terrestrial carbon storage.
