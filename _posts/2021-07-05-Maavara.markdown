Sunlight can oxidize dissolved organic carbon (DOC) to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) 
in freshwaters. The importance of complete photooxidation, or photomineralization, as a 
sink for DOC remains unclear in temperate rivers, as most estimates are restricted to 
lakes, high latitude rivers, and coastal river plumes. In this study, we construct a model 
representing over 75,000 river reaches in the Connecticut River Watershed (CRW), USA, to 
calculate spectrally resolved photomineralization. We test the hypothesis that 
photomineralization is a negligible DOC sink across all reaches and flow conditions 
relative to DOC fluxes. Our model quantifies reaction rates and transport drivers within 
the river reaches for the ranges of flow conditions, incoming solar irradiance, and canopy 
cover shading observed throughout the year. Our model predicts average daily areal 
photomineralization rates ranging from 1.16 mg-C m−2 day−1 in low flow river reaches in 
the winter, to 18.33 mg-C m−2 day−1 in high flow river reaches during the summer. Even for
 high photomineralization fluxes, corresponding photomineralization uptake velocities are 
 typically at least an order of magnitude smaller than those reported for other instream 
 processes. We calculate DOC elimination by photomineralization relative to DOC fluxes 
 through individual stream reaches as well as the entire riverine portion of the CRW. 
 We find that relative photomineralization fluxes are highest in summer drought conditions
  in low order streams. In median flows and mean light intensities, for an average 
  watershed travel distance, 3%–5% of the DOC fluxes are eliminated, indicating that 
  photomineralization is a minor DOC sink in temperate rivers.
