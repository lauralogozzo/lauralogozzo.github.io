  Laura Logozzo is a PhD Candidate working with Dr. Peter Raymond at the Yale School of Forestry 
  and Environmental Studies. Her research focuses on the biogeochemistry of large river
  systems. In particular, she is interested in interactions between dissolved organic
  matter and iron.
  
  Originally from Brooklyn, NY, she attended Fiorello H. LaGuardia H.S., majoring in fine arts.
  She received her B.S. and M.S. from CUNY City College of New York, where she studied Earth 
  and Atmospheric Sciences. Her Master's thesis examined the export of colored dissolved 
  organic matter from Chesapeake Bay tidal marshes, and its subsequent photochemical and microbial 
  degradation in estuaries.
